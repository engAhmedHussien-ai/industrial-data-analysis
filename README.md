## Scripted Analysis

In addition to exploratory notebooks, this project includes a standalone
Python script (`scripts/anomaly_detection.py`) that implements the full
analysis pipeline for batch or automated execution.

This reflects real-world industrial analytics workflows where analysis
must be repeatable, auditable, and production-ready.
