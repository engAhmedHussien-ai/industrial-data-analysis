## Scripted Analysis

In addition to exploratory notebooks, this project includes a standalone
Python script (`scripts/anomaly_detection.py`) that implements the full
analysis pipeline for batch or automated execution.

This reflects real-world industrial analytics workflows where analysis
must be repeatable, auditable, and production-ready.

## Energy & KPI Analysis

The project also includes an energy-focused analytics script
(`scripts/energy_kpis.py`) that computes operational KPIs such as
energy consumption, average and peak power, load utilization,
and operating hours.

This reflects common industrial and energy-management use cases,
including performance benchmarking and efficiency analysis.

## Reports & Business Insights

The `/reports` directory contains automatically generated plots
and a business-focused insights summary (`INSIGHTS.md`) that
translate analytical results into operational recommendations.

This mirrors real-world industrial analytics deliverables for
engineering, maintenance, and management stakeholders.
